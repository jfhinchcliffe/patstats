#PatStats

An app to check whether random stops are returning real time values from the PTV API.
Also checks the weather for the office location.
JSON endpoints are to feed the team Geckoboard
Hosted on Heroku: https://calm-falls-50903.herokuapp.com/

#todo

* DRY up ptv_controller / clean up the methods
* Add testing
* Add functionality to login and manually add stop info (rather than hardcoding in controller)
* Add a way to throttle API calls
